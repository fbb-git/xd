<h2 >NAME</h2>xd - eXtra fast Directory changer
<p>

<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
       <strong >xd</strong> [OPTIONS] <em >arguments</em>
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
The program <strong >xd</strong> is used to perform e<strong >X</strong>tra fast <strong >D</strong>irectory
changes. Usually to change a directory the user is required to enter a command
like, e.g., <em >cd /usr/local/bin</em>, possibly with the aid of shell
completion. In many cases this is a tedious task: shell completion shows all
entries, including files, when we're only interested in directories and the
full specification of our intented directory may eventually require many
keyboard actions.
<p>
<strong >Xd</strong> was designed a long time ago (in the early 90s) to reduce the
effort of changing directories. Often we're well aware to which directory we
want to change, and it's easy to produce the initial directory characters of
that directory. E.g., if the intent is to <em >cd</em> to <em >/usr/local/bin</em>,
it's quite easy to produce the letters <em >ulb</em>. 
<p>
<strong >Xd</strong> capitalizes on this capability. By providing the initial directory
characters of directories <strong >xd</strong> determines the proper expansion allowing you
to change directories fast. So, entering the command <em >xd ulb</em> results in the
expansion <em >/usr/local/bin</em>.
<p>
Often life is not that easy. Often there are multiple expansions from a
given set of initial characters. E.g., when entering <em >xd ulb</em> <strong >xd</strong> may
find several alternatives. E.g.,
        <pre>

 1: /usr/lib/base-config
 2: /usr/lib/bonobo
 3: /usr/lib/bonobo-activation
 4: /usr/local/bin
        
</pre>

    If these are the alternatives, this is exactly what <strong >xd</strong> will show
you. Then, by simply pressing the <em >3</em> key (<em >no</em> <em >Enter</em> key required)
<strong >xd</strong> will produce the required <em >/usr/local/bin</em>. 
<p>
Commands to <strong >xd</strong> can be specified so as to fine-tune <strong >xd</strong>'s behavior:
    <ul>
    <li> By default (as specified by the configuration file, see below)
expansions may start at the user's home directory or at the system's root
directory.
    <li> Initial character <strong >/</strong>: If the first character of the command is
<em >/</em> then all expansions are performed from the system's root
directory. E.g., <em >xd /t</em> results in <em >/tmp</em> but not in <em >/home/user/tmp</em>.
    <li> Initial character <strong >.</strong>: If the first character of the command is
<em >.</em> then all expansions are performed from the user's home directory. E.g.,
<em >xd .t</em> results in <em >/home/user/tmp</em> but not in <em >/tmp</em>
    <li> Initial character <strong >0</strong>: If the first character of the command is
<em >0</em>, then all expansions start at the current working directory. In fact,
this is a specialization of the following, more general form:
    <li> Initial character <strong >1..9</strong>: If the first character of the command is
a digit between <em >1</em> and <em >9</em> then all expansions start at that parent
directory level of the current working directory (up to the system's root
directory). E.g., if the current working directory is <em >/usr/share/doc</em> then
<em >xd 2lb</em> will offer the alterative <em >/usr/local/bin</em>: two steps up, then
look for directories starting with <em >l</em> and therein directories starting with
<em >b</em>.
    <li> Separators (space, and the forward slash (<em > </em>, and /)):
sometimes it is clear that there are many alternatives and the intention is to
reduce that number. By using separators subsequently nested directories must
start with the characters between the separators. E.g., <em >xd u l bi</em> never
produces the alternative <em >/usr/lib/base-config</em> anymore, since
<em >base-config</em> does not start with <em >bi</em>. In this case only
<em >/usr/local/bin</em> is produced. When used as initial character in a pattern
the forward slash always indicates the root-directory.
    
    </ul>
    If there's only one solution, <strong >Xd</strong> writes that directory to its standard
output stream. If there are multiple solutions, then a list of at most 62
alternatives (10 for the numbers 0..9, 26 for the letters a..z and 26 for the
letters A..Z) is written to the standard error stream from which the user
may select an alternative by simply pressing the key associated with the
selection of choice. If no selection is requested any other key may be pressed
(e.g., the space bar or the <em >Enter</em> key). If there is no solutioon <strong >xd</strong>
writes the text <em >No Solutions</em> to the standard error stream.
<p>
When <strong >xd</strong> is given at least one argument, all its output is sent to the
standard error stream, but for the selected directory name which is written to
the standard output stream. If no selection is made or if the selection
process is aborted a single dot is written to the standard output
stream. Usually <strong >xd</strong> will be called by a shell alias, providing the
<em >cd</em> command with <strong >xd</strong>'s output (see below at the <strong >SHELL SCRIPTS</strong>
section) executing <em >cd `xd $*`</em>. The default dot produced by <strong >xd</strong> 
prevents an unintended change of directory.
<p>
When <strong >xd</strong> is merely given an initial directory specification, like a
single dot (<em >.</em>) or digit (a digit in the set <em >[0..9]</em>) then <strong >xd</strong>
returns the implied path. Specifying a parent before the root-directory (E.g.,
entering `<em >xd 5</em>' when the current working directory is `<em >/tmp</em>') results
in writing the root directory (`<em >/</em>') to the standard output stream.
<p>
If <strong >xd</strong> is called without arguments then <em >usage</em> information is
written to the standard error stream.
<p>
<strong >Xd</strong> may be further configured using options and a configuration file,
discussed in the <strong >OPTIONS</strong> and <strong >CONFIGURATION FILE</strong> sections below.
<p>
<h2 >GENERALIZED DIRECTORY SEARCH</h2>
<p>
Starting with version 3.10.0 <strong >xd</strong> also supports generalized directory
search command processing (GDS). When GDS is requested separators are no
longer required, and <strong >xd</strong> will find all possible alternatives resulting from
all possible sequential combinations of the initial search command. GDS is
activated either by specifying the <em >-g</em> command line flag or by entering
<em >generalized-search</em> in <strong >xd</strong>'s configuration file. Alternatively, when the
latter is specified then the <em >--traditional</em> command line option will
suppress GDS.
<p>
When using GDS each initial substring of the command to <strong >xd</strong> is
considered as the initial characters of a directory. E.g., if the command
<em >xd tmps</em> is entered using GDS then directories matching the following
search patterns will be found;
    <ul>
    <li> <em >/t*/m*/p*/s*/</em>
    <li> <em >/t*/m*/ps*/</em>
    <li> <em >/t*/mp*/s*/</em>
    <li> <em >/t*/mps*/</em>
    <li> <em >/tm*/p*/s*/</em>
    <li> <em >/tm*/ps*/</em>
    <li> <em >/tmp*/s*/</em>
    <li> <em >/tmps*/</em>
    </ul>
    Using the traditional processing mode only the first one of these
alternative patterns is considered.
<p>
Multiple command line arguments, the slash and the underscore can still be
used with GDS in which case they force a directory change in the considered
patterns. E.g., with the command <em >xd tm/ps</em> the following patterns will be
considered: 
    <ul>
    <li> <em >/t*/m*/p*/s*/</em>
    <li> <em >/t*/m*/ps*/</em>
    <li> <em >/tm*/p*/s*/</em>
    <li> <em >/tm*/ps*/</em>
    </ul>
    In this set all of the previous patterns showing the <em >...mp...</em>
combination were dropped, as a directory change is forced between the <em >m</em>
and <em >p</em> characters.
<p>
<h2 >RETURN VALUE</h2>
<p>
<strong >Xd</strong> returns 0 to the operating system unless an error occurs (e.g.,
when a non-existing configuration file is specified), or <strong >xd</strong>'s version or
usage info is shown or requested.
<p>
<h2 >OPTIONS</h2>
<p>
If available, single letter options are listed between parentheses
following their associated long-option variants. Single letter options require
arguments if their associated long options require arguments as well.
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >--add-root</strong> <em >condition</em><br/>
            If the search starts at the user's home directory an additional
search starting at the system's root directory may be performed as well,
depending on the value specified for the <em >add-root</em> option. Alternatives are
<em >never</em> (no additional search is performed); <em >if-empty</em> (an additional
search is performed if the initial search did not yield any directory); or
<em >always</em> (an additional search is always performed).  There is also a
configuration file directive <em >add-root</em> (see below).
<p>
<li> <strong >--all</strong> <strong >-a</strong><br/>
        If the configuration file (see below) contains <em >ignore</em> directives
then these directives are ignored when computing the alternatives from which
the user may select a directory to change to.
<p>
<li> <strong >--config-file</strong>=<em >filename</em> (<strong >-c</strong>)<br/>
           The name of an <strong >xd</strong> configuration file. By default <strong >xd</strong> 
            looks for the file <em >.xdrc</em> in the user's home directory. The
            existence of the default file is optional.
<p>
<li> <strong >--directories</strong> <em >inclusion</em><br/>
        Directories may be also be reached via symbolic links. The inclusion
type <em >all</em> adds these symbolic links to the list of alternatives. The
inclusion type <em >unique</em> prevents symbolic links from being added to
the list of alternatives. There is also a configuration file directive
<em >directories</em> (see below).
<p>
<li> <strong >--generalized-search</strong> <strong >-g</strong><br/>
        When this option is specified <strong >xd</strong> uses GDS unless the
directive <em >traditional</em> is specified in the configuration file.
<p>
<li> <strong >--help</strong> (<strong >-h</strong>)<br/>
           Basic usage information is written to the standard error stream.
<p>
<li> <strong >--history</strong> <em >[filename]</em><br/>
        A history of previously made choices is kept in the file
<em >filename</em>. If <em >--history</em> is specified, but the filename is 
left empty the history file <em >$HOME/.xd.his</em> is used. This file should only
be modified by <strong >xd</strong> itself. If you can't resist editing it then use the
following example showing the format of the lines in the history file.
        <pre>

    1292596154 1 /home/frank/svn/xd/
        
</pre>

    The first field is the time (in seconds since the epoch) the entry was
written, the second field is the number of times the entry has been selected
and the third field is the associated path.
<p>
<li> <strong >--history-lifetime</strong> <em >spec</em><br/>
    The lifetime of the entries in the history file. The specification
consists of a number followed by <em >D, W, M</em> or <em >Y</em>, representing,
resp. days, weeks, months, or years. A month is considered a period of 30
days, a year a period of 365 days. If the specification is omitted a lifetime
of <em >1M</em> (one month) is used. Entries older than <em >history-lifetime</em> are
disregarded as history-items and are removed from the history file.
<p>
<li> <strong >--history-maxsize</strong> <em >nr</em><br/>
    The maximum number of entries the history file may contain. By default
there is no limit. When <em >history-maxsize</em> is specified and more than the
maximum number of history items are found in the history file then the <em >nr</em>
most popular choices are kept. Usually the cut-off point will be somewhere
within a popularity category. In that case the most recently selected
alternatives within that category are kept.
<p>
<li> <strong >--history-position</strong> <em >[top|bottom]</em><br/>
    When this option is specified then previously found alternatives 
are displayed either at the top of the list or at the bottom
of the list. If this option is omitted then the elements in the history will
be intermixed with new alternatives. The next option <em >history-separate</em> is
only used when this option is also specified. By merely specifying
<em >history-position</em> the history items are shown at the top of the list.
<p>
<li> <strong >--history-separate</strong><br/>
    When specified, a blank line is written between the items in the history
and new alternatives (not previously selected). This option is only
interpreted when the previous option is also specified.
<p>
<li> <strong >--icase</strong> <strong >-i</strong><br/>
    This option is used to specify case-insensitive pattern matching. E.g.,
specifying <em >xd /ub</em> returns the directory <em >/usr/bin</em>, but not a directory
like <em >/UnSpecified/Books</em>, which is returned by <em >xd /UB</em>. However, <em >xd
-i /ub</em> (using any letter casing for the specification) returns both
directories. The option <em >icase</em> could of course be specified in the
configuration file, which which case case-insensitive matching is used by
default. In the latter case specifying <em >-i</em> as a command line option reverts
the matching procedure to case-sensitive directory matching. In general, when
an even number of <em >icase</em> specifications is provided <strong >xd</strong> uses
case-sensitive directory matching, while an odd number of <em >icase</em>
specifications results in case-insensitive directory matching.
<p>
<li> <strong >--start-at</strong> <em >origin</em><br/>
        Defines the default start location of directory searches. Origin
<em >home</em> results in all default searches to start at the user's home
directory. Origin <em >root</em> results in searches to begin at the disk's root
(<em >/</em>) directory. There is also a configuration file directive <em >start-at</em>
(see below).
<p>
<li> <strong >--traditional</strong><br/>
        When this option is specified <strong >xd</strong> will not use GDS but will use its
traditional mode. It overrules a <em >generalized-search</em> directive specified in
the configuration file as well as the <em >-g</em> option.
<p>
<li> <strong >--verbose</strong> (<strong >-V</strong>)<br/> 
           More extensive information about the actions taken by the <strong >xd</strong>
program is written to the standard error stream.
<p>
<li> <strong >--version</strong> (<strong >-v</strong>)<br/>
           <strong >Xd</strong>'s version number is written to the standard error stream.
    </ul>    
<p>
<h2 >CONFGURATION FILE</h2>
<p>
The default configuration file is <em >.xdrc</em> in the user's home directory. It
may be overruled by the program's <em >--config-file</em> option.
<p>
Empty lines are ignored. Information at and beyond <em >#</em>-characters is
interpreted as comment and is ignored as well.
<p>
All directives in <strong >xd</strong> configuration files follow the pattern 
    <pre>

    directive value
    
</pre>
 
    but for some directives <em >value</em> is optional.
<p>
A line may at most contain one directive, but white space (including
comment at the end of the line) is OK. The same directive may be specified
multiple times, in which case the <em >last</em> directive will be used (with the
exception of the <em >ignore</em> directive, see below). All
directives  are interpreted <em >case sensitively</em>.  Non-empty lines
not beginning with a recognized directive are silently ignored.
<p>
The following directives can be used in the 
configuration file. Default values are shown between parentheses.
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >add-root</strong> <em >when</em> (if-empty)<br/>
            If the search starts at the user's home directory an additional
search starting at the system's root directory may be performed as well,
depending on the value specified for the <em >add-root</em> directive. <br/>
    If <em >when</em> is specified as <em >always</em> then an additional search is
always performed.<br/>
            If it is specified as <em >if-empty</em> then an additional search is
performed if the initial search (starting at the user's home directory) did
not yield any directory.<br/>
            If it is specified as <em >never</em> no additional search is
performed.<br/>
    This directive is overruled by the <em >---add-root</em> command line option.
<p>
<li> <strong >directories</strong> <em >which</em> (all)<br/>
        Directories may be also be reached via symbolic links. The
specification <em >all</em> will add these symbolic links to the list of
alternatives. The specification <em >unique</em> will prevent the symbolic links
from being added to the list of alternatives.<br/>
    This directive is overruled by the <em >---directories</em> command line option.
<p>
<li> <strong >generalized-search</strong> <br/>
        When this directive is specified <strong >xd</strong> will use GDS by default.
<p>
<li> <strong >history</strong> <em >[filename]</em><br/>
        A history of previously made choices is kept in the file
<em >filename</em>. If <em >history</em> is specified, but the filename is 
left empty the history file <em >$HOME/.xd.his</em> is used. This file should only
be modified by <strong >xd</strong> itself. If you can't resist editing it then use the
following example showing the format of the lines in the history file.
        <pre>

    1292596154 1 /home/frank/svn/xd/
        
</pre>

    The first field is the time (in seconds since the epoch) the entry was
written, the second field is the number of times the entry has been selected
and the third field is the associated path.
<p>
<li> <strong >history-lifetime</strong> <em >spec</em><br/>
    The lifetime of the entries in the history file. The specification
consists of a number followed by <em >D, W, M</em> or <em >Y</em>, representing,
resp. days, weeks, months, or years. A month is considered a period of 30
days, a year a period of 365 days. If the specification is omitted a lifetime
of <em >1M</em> (one month) is used. Entries older than <em >history-lifetime</em> are
disregarded as history-items and are removed from the history file.
<p>
<li> <strong >history-maxsize</strong> <em >nr</em><br/>
    The maximum number of entries the history file may contain. By default
there is no limit. When <em >history-maxsize</em> is specified and more than the
maximum number of history items are found in the history file then the <em >nr</em>
latest choices are kept. Each previously made selection counts as one.  If a
new alternative is selected it always becomes an element in the history list.
<p>
<li> <strong >history-position</strong> <em >[top|bottom]</em><br/>
    When specified alternatives found in the history will be displayed either
at the top of the list or at the bottom of the list. If this option is omitted
then the elements in the history will be intermixed with new alternatives. The
next directive <em >history-separate</em> is only used when this directive is also
specified. By merely specifying <em >history-position</em> the history items are
shown at the top of the list.
<p>
<li> <strong >history-separate</strong><br/>
    When specified, a blank line is written between the items in the history
and new alternatives (not previously selected). This directive is only
interpreted when the previous directive is also specified. 
<p>
<li> <strong >--icase</strong> <strong >-i</strong><br/>
    This specification is used to request case-insensitive pattern
matching. If this option is entered in the configuration file then specifying
<em >xd /ub</em> returns the directory <em >/usr/bin</em> as welll as a directory like
(assuming it exists) <em >/UnSpecified/Books</em>. When specified in the
configuration file, the command-line option <em >-i</em> reverts the matching
procedure back to case-sensitive directory matching. In general, when an even
number of <em >icase</em> specifications is provided <strong >xd</strong> uses case-sensitive
directory matching, while an odd number of <em >icase</em> specifications results in
case-insensitive directory matching.
<p>
<li> <strong >ignore</strong> <em >path</em> <br/>
        The configuration file may contain multiple <em >ignore</em> directives
which are --different from the way other directives are handled-- all
interpreted. Each <em >ignore</em> directive is followed by a path specification as
shown in a list of alternatives produced by <strong >xd</strong> or an initial substring of
such a path terminating in a <em >*</em> character. When <strong >xd</strong> encounters a path
matching any of the <em >ignore</em> directives (with the <em >*</em> interpreted as `any
further directory name' specification) it will not display that path in its
list of alternatives.
    This directive is overruled by the <em >---all</em> command line option.
<p>
<li> <strong >start-at</strong> <em >value</em> (home) <br/>
           Defines the default start location of directory searches. Values
are <em >home</em> and <em >root</em>. When <em >home</em> is specified all searches start at
the user's home directory. When <em >root</em> is specified searches start at the
disk's root (<em >/</em>) directory. If the directory is omitted or if another value
is specified then the default is used, which is <em >home</em>. This directive is
overruled by the <em >---start-at</em> command line option.
<p>
<li> <strong >traditional</strong> <br/>
        This directive may be used to request the use of <strong >xd</strong>'s traditional
mode. It overrules the <em >-g</em> command line option and the
<em >generalized-search</em> directive.
    </ul>
)
<p>
<h2 >SHELL SCRIPTS</h2>
<p>
Assuming <strong >xd</strong> is installed in <em >/usr/bin</em> scripts can be defined around
<strong >xd</strong> for various shell programs. This allows the shell to change directories
under control of <strong >xd</strong>.
<p>
To use <strong >xd</strong> with the <strong >bash</strong>(1)-shell, the following function
can be used (which could be added to, e.g., <em >.bash_login</em>):
        <pre>

  xd()                    # function to do `cd` using `xd`
  {
      cd "`/usr/bin/xd $*`"
  }
        
</pre>

<p>
To use <strong >xd</strong> with the <strong >tcsh</strong>(1)-shell, the following alias 
can be added to, e.g., the <em >~/.alias</em> file:
        <pre>

  alias  xd  'cd `\xd \!*`'
        
</pre>

    If your system uses blanks in directory names, the above tcsh-alias cannot
be used as the blanks are interpreted as argument-separaters. In that case the
following alias can be defined:
        <pre>

  alias  xd  'setenv XD "`\xd \!*`";cd "$XD"'
        
</pre>

<p>
Having defined the <strong >xd</strong> alias or script <em >xd ...</em> commands results
in the automatic (or optional) change of the current working directory
<p>
<h2 >EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>
<pre>

    xd ulb      - all directories starting subsequently, 
                  with u, l and b origin is default, or 
                  specified in .xdrc as  home or root

    xd 0t       - all directories starting with t below the cwd

    xd 2t       - all directories starting at the `grandparent' 
                  (2 steps up) of the cwd

    xd --start-at root t
                - all directories at the root starting with t

    xd ..       - all directories starting with a dot in the cwd

    xd .        - the user's home directory

    xd 0        - the current working directory

    xd 1        - the current directory's parent directory
    
</pre>

    Assuming the following directories exist:
    <pre>

  /usr/lib/bonobo
  /usr/lib/bonobo-activation
  /usr/local/bin
    
</pre>

    then the following two <em >ignore</em> specifications in <strong >xd</strong>'s configuration
file will result in ignoring the <em >bonobo</em> directory alternatives:
<p>
First specification:
    <pre>

  ignore /usr/lib/bonobo
  ignore /usr/lib/bonobo-activation
    
</pre>

    Second specification:
    <pre>

  ignore /usr/lib/bonobo*

<h2 >ABOUT xd</h2>
<p>
The program <strong >xd</strong> was initially (before 1994) written for the MS-DOS
platform. In 1994 it was designed to work under Unix (Linux, AIX) and it was
converted to <strong >C++</strong>. The original <strong >C++</strong> code is still available
(<em >https://oosix.icce.rug.nl/svnroot/xd/tags/start/xd/</em>) and is funny to look
at as it is a remarkable illustration of <strong >C++</strong> code written by <strong >C</strong>
programmers who had just learned about <strong >C++</strong>. Versions <em >2.x</em> have been
