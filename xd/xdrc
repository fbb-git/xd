#   This file contains the preferences for XD (well... just one for now).
#   If you want to set up preferences differring from the default,
#   then this file should be named $HOME/.conf/xd/xd.conf.
#   If you don't have a file  $HOME/.conf/xd/xd.conf, and root *has*
#   a  $HOME/.conf/xd/xd.conf, then the preferences of root prevail.

#   If no ...conf/xd/xd.conf is active for you, then the default XD
#   preferences are used. It is:

#       home        true
#       directories all

#   The home preference may be set to true or false. If 'false' is specified,
#   expansions will start at the / directory. If 'true' is specified
#   (or no home is given) all expansions normally start at $HOME.

#   The 'directories all' may be changed into 'directories unique' if all
#   solutions of directories are to be presented. This will include links
#   to directories as well as the directories themselves.

#   The following situations defines alternatives,
#   the cells contain possible command-specifications:
#   
#   ----------------------------------------------------------
#                       sub-pattern specification
#   ----------------------------------------------------------
#   intention       false           yes
#   ----------------------------------------------------------
#   from current        .abc (11)       ./a/bc (12)
#                           ./abc
#   from $HOME      abc  (21)       -a/bc  (22)
#                           -abc
#   from /          /abc (31)       /a/bc  (32)
#                           //abc
#   from parent #       #abc (41)       #a/bc  (42)
#   (#: [0-9]                   #/abc
#   ----------------------------------------------------------
#
#   command[0] determines the initial cell:
#       .   indicates from the current directory onward
#       /   indicates from the root
#       -   indicates subspecifications from $HOME
#       #   (#: [0-9]) indicates specifications from parent #
#       other   indicates from $HOME
#
#       any / or - beyond command[0] automatically switches to
#       sub-specifications (the last / on command is not counted
#       here, as this one was added by Command() itself.

#   For root, $HOME is of course /. If `home false' is selected,
#   then the root-expansion is used.


# The search line defines additional expansions performed by xd if expansions
# from the root fail. By default, failing expansions from $HOME will cause 
# additional expansion to be tried starting from the / directory.  If you
# don't want this to happen, activate the following line:
#   addRoot false
#   addRoot ifEmpty
#   addRoot true

# if you want the root to be searched even if a search from $HOME returns
# directories, activate the following line:
#   search 

# here are the defaults: all specifications are interpreted case insensitively
# and if multiple specifications are included in this file, the last one will
# be used.

#   home            true
#   directories     all
#   addRoot         true
# directories unique
# home false
