#   XD configuration file example

#   Default location used by xd: $HOME/.xdrc

#   If you don't have a file  $HOME/.xdrc and did not specify a configuration
#   file using the --config-file command line option then program defined
#   defaults (shown here as well) will be used.

#   All directives and values are interpreted case sensitively

#   When directives are provided repeatedly the last directive will be used
#   (except for ignore, which are all interpreted)

#   The program defined default is shown where applicable as a commented out
#   example


# The add-root directive determines when to perform an additional search
#starting from the root (/) directory:
#       always      - an additional search is always performed.
#       if-empty    - an additional search is performed if the initial search 
#                     did not yield any directory.
#       never       - no additional search is performed.
#add-root if-empty

#   The directories directive defines which directives are shown:
#       all     - show all alternatives, including symbolic links (symlinks)
#       unique  - do not show symlinks to directories
#directories all

# The generalized-search (GDS) on is specified bf(xd) directory separators are
# no longer required, and xd finds all posible alternatives resulting from
# all possible sequential combinations of the initial search command.
# Directory separators are honored when specified, even when
# generalized-search is specified. However, they are *required* if 
# generalized-search is not specified or (same thing) if 
#traditional
# is instead specified.
generalized-search

#   The ignore directives (multiple ignore directives are all interpreted)
#   defines directories that should not appear in alternative
#   lists. Specifications may end in a final *, indicating that all
#   directories matching the provided pattern will be ignored. 
#   There is no default. Some exampes:
#       ignore /usr/lib/bonobo/
#       ignore /usr/lib/bonobo-activation/
#   or, using a wildcard:
#       ignore /usr/lib/bonobo*

#   The start-at directive defines the origin of the search:
#       home    - start the search from the user's home dir.
#       root    - start the search from the root (/) directory.
#start-at home

#   Specify the name of the history file if a history of previously made 
#   choices most be kept. If only the 'history' directive is specified the
#   history file will be $HOME/.xd.his
#   Remaining history- directives only have an effect if the 'history'
#   directive is also specified
#history

#   Specify the maximum lifetime of history items. Use D(ays), W(eeks),
#   M(onths) or Y(ears), prefixed by a number. By default 1M is used
#history-lifetime 1M

#   Specify the maximum size of the history. By default no limit.
#   The value shown serves as an example.
#history-maxsize 10

#   Specify the postion of the history items. When merely the directive is 
#   specified the history items are shown at the top of the
#   list. Alternatively, use 'history-position bottom'
#history-position top

#   When history-position is specified then 'history-separate' can be used to
#   insert a blank line between history items and new alternatives.
history-separate

#   Multiple ignore specifications may be specified. Directories matching the
#   specification will not show up in the list of alternatives. Specifications
#   should end in a *
#ignore /usr/lib/bonobo*

#   The icase option is used to specify case-insensitive pattern matching. By
#   default case sensitive pattern matching is used.
#icase
