#   XD configuration file example

#   Default location used by xd: $HOME/.xdrc

#   If you don't have a file  $HOME/.xdrc and did not specify a configuration
#   file using the --config-file command line option then program defined
#   defaults (shown here as well) will be used.

#   All directives and values are interpreted case sensitively

#   When directives are provided repeatedly the last directive will be used
#   (except for ignore, which are all interpreted)

#   The program defined default is shown where applicable as a commented out
#   example


# The add-root directive determines when to perform an additional search
#starting from the root (/) directory:
#       always      - an additional search is always performed.
#       if-empty    - an additional search is performed if the initial search 
#                     did not yield any directory.
#       never       - no additional search is performed.
#add-root if-empty

#   The directories directive defines which directives are shown:
#       all     - show all alternatives, including symbolic links (symlinks)
#       unique  - do not show symlinks to directories
#directories all

#   The ignore directives (multiple ignore directives are all interpreted)
#   defines directories that should not appear in alternative
#   lists. Specifications may end in a final *, indicating that all
#   directories matching the provided pattern will be ignored. 
#   There is no default. Some exampes:
#       ignore /usr/lib/bonobo/
#       ignore /usr/lib/bonobo-activation/
#   or, using a wildcard:
#       ignore /usr/lib/bonobo*

#   The start-at directive defines the origin of the search:
#       home    - start the search from the user's home dir.
#       root    - start the search from the root (/) directory.
#start-at home
