xd (3.26.00)

  * Patterns only specifying a starting directory are accepted, and return the
    full path of starting directories. E.g., 'xd .' returns the user's home
    directory, and 'xd 3' returns the path three levels up from the current
    working directory.

xd (3.25.00)

  * Initial directory specifiers 0-9 can now be used with and without
    separators. E.g., 'xd 0lb' and 'xd 0 lb' are equivalent.

  * The underscore is not used as separator anymore: the man-page was updated
    accordingly. 

  * Renamed xd.* to main.* (synchronizing names with other projects)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 05 Oct 2016 15:06:54 +0200

xd (3.24.01)

  * Applied cosmetic changes to alternatives/getcwd.c (3.24.00's changes are
    merged with this version).

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 21 Feb 2016 14:32:19 +0100

xd (3.24.00)

  * The xd-support scripts that are mentioned in the man-page now allow
    (ugly!!!) blanks in directory names.

  * Updated the manual page.

  * Repaired the description of the initial . and 0 in the usage message.

  * Removed a dependency on PATH_MAX (in alternatives/getcwd.cc)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 21 Feb 2016 12:45:28 +0100

xd (3.23.04)

  * Adapted the build scripts to icmake 8.00.04

  * README.g++-5 now superfluous and removed.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 20 Dec 2015 10:45:43 +0100

xd (3.23.03)

  * Kevin Brodsky observed that the installation scripts used 'chdir' rather
    than 'cd'. Fixed in this release.

  * Kevin Brodsky also observed that the combined size of all precompiled 
    headers might exceed some disks capacities. The option -P was added to the
    ./build script to prevent the use of precompiled headers.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 05 Oct 2015 21:28:25 +0200

xd (3.23.02)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 02 Oct 2015 13:48:25 +0200

xd (3.23.01)

  * Repaired a small flaw in the man-page

  * Added the missing 'generalized-search' (cq. 'traditional') demo-entry to
    the sample xdrc file

  * Added the file 'required' summarizing the software which was used for
    building xd.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 19 Jan 2015 20:07:19 +0100

xd (3.23.00)

  * Added --icase (-i) allowing case insensitive directory matching

  * Changed compilation option --std=c++0x to --std=c++14

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 11 Dec 2014 13:14:01 +0100

xd (3.22.09)

  * Added missing (since g++ 2.8.2) #include <sstream> to alternatives.ih

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 12 Nov 2013 09:33:03 +0100

xd (3.22.08)

  * Catching std::exceptions instead of FBB::Errno exceptions

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 24 Jan 2013 13:42:22 +0100

xd (3.22.07)

  * Using Glob(Glob::DIRECTORY, ... to find directories

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 29 Oct 2012 11:50:45 +0100

xd (3.22.06)

  * Added the build-depends file and updated the INSTALL file.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 28 Oct 2012 10:06:05 +0100

xd (3.22.05)

  * The following #defines in INSTALL.im can be overruled by defining
    identically named environment variables: 
        CXX      defines the name of the compiler to use. By default `g++'
        CXXFLAGS the options passed to the compiler. 
                 By default `-Wall --std=c++0x -O2 -g'
        LDFLAGS  the options passed to the linker. By default no options are
                 passed to the linker.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 18 Jul 2012 15:39:24 +0200

xd (3.22.04)

  * New upstream release, cosmetic changes (removed 3.22.03 headers again)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 10 May 2012 15:55:34 +0200

xd (3.22.03)

  * New version requires bobcat >= 3.00.00

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 03 May 2012 20:30:17 +0200

xd (3.22.02)

  * New version to link against bobcat 2.20.02, changes some for_eaches into
    range-based for-loops

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 06 Jan 2012 08:55:35 +0100

xd (3.22.01)

  * `build' script now recognizes CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS for, resp. g++ and ld
     flags. Default values are set in INSTALL.im, as before.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 26 Jun 2011 15:09:45 +0200

xd (3.22.00)

  * Replaced Bobcat's FnWrap* calls by lambda functions

  * The 'build' script now uses the -g option by default (set in
    INSTALL.im). To modify the g++ compilation options change the #define
    CPPOPT in INSTALL.im. By default it is set to "-O2 -g". To modify the
    flags `on the fly' set the environment variable CPPFLAGS, overruling
    CPPOPT.  The option "-Wall" is always used and should not be altered.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 14 Jun 2011 21:06:15 +0200

xd (3.21.00)

  * The history retention mechanism has been simplified. Either the last x
    number of history lines are kept (using --history-maxsize) or the most
    recent history lines (as specified by --history-lifetime) are kept. 

  * The selected choice is always given the current time stamp, so if a
    history is kept, in will always contain the most recently made choice.

  * The GPL is added to the tar.gz archive created by trunk/sourcetar

  * Superfluous icmake files (rebuild, manual) were removed.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 18 Feb 2011 15:23:45 +0100

xd (3.20.0)

  * Continuation patterns following a pattern not matching any file are
    pruned, speeding up XD's search process.

  * Added memory for previous selections, showing the popular alternatives
    matching a search pattern either at the beginning or at the end of the
    list of alternatives. Using history is optional, cf. the xd(1) man-page.

  * This version requires bobcat >= 2.10.0

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 17 Dec 2010 21:30:18 +0100

xd (3.12.0)

   * XD now requires Bobcat >= 2.09.00, using Bobcat's Mstream objects for
     message handling

   * Changed all fnwrap1c calls into fnwrap::unary calls

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 29 Oct 2010 10:24:43 +0200

xd (3.11.0)

   * Generalized search didn't recognize plain directories to ignore unless a
     trailing * was appended. Now fixed.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 25 Sep 2009 22:27:31 +0200

xd (3.10.2)

   * Using compiler option --std=c++0x

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 30 Aug 2009 11:47:49 +0200

xd (3.10.1)

   * XD's home directory now at http://xd-home.sourceforge.net/

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 28 Mar 2009 10:47:36 +0100

xd (3.10.0)

  * Implemented Generalized Directory Search (GDS) inserting directory
    separators at all possible positions of the search string. See the
    man-page for details. GDS use is optional. 

xd (3.00.1)

  * Minor modifications due to changes in Bobcat

xd (3.00.0)

  * Complete rewrite of XD according to current views about C++
    
  * This version is now formally offered to Debian Linux

  * Implemented 'ignore' and other directives and extended the earlier set
    of command line options. 

  * Added a man-page. See the man page and xd's usage info shown when the
    program is started without arguments for details about how to use xd

  * The default configuration file is now ~/.xdrc

  * Current configuration defaults are:
        add-root    if-empty
        directories all
        start-at    home

    
xd (2.13)

  * Made XD selfsupporting. libicce isn't required anymore.
    Adapted `build': now uses the -t argument
        
xd (2.11)

  * Oops, embedded links weren't recognized in 2.10. Now the algorithm is
    modified so as to compare the inode/device information. What comes
    first is taken first: it may be the directory link. Apart from that:
    the same operational functionality as in 2.10.
    The line 'directories pure' should now be 'directories unique',
    but it's also the default, so it can safely be omitted.

xd (2.10)

  * Solutions reducing to the same file (e.g., via links)
    are prevented by default. In order to get all solutions
    the line 'directories all' must be included in the xd.conf file.

xd (2.09)

  * libicce.a is now containing the NonCanon etc. classes. The formerly
    used library libcclib.a. This library and the ICString.h, ICError.h,
    ARG.h, NonCanon.h and ConfigFile.h files (normally in
    /usr/local/include) can be removed. The functionality of xd has
    not been changed.

xd (2.08)

  * from the $HOME directory fails.

  * In xd.conf this may be suppressed by entering a line containing
        extra no

  * Alternatively, the extra evaluation may be forced in addition to the
    standard evaluation (from the $HOME directory) if the line
        extra always
    is used in xd.conf
    
  * In the distribution, the xd.conf file is now expected in
    $HOME/.conf/xd/xd.conf
    
  * Prior to the compilation, this path may be set by altering
    XD_CONF_PATH in the file configure.h
    
xd (2.07)

  * First Linux version. Previous versions were for MS-DOS
