xd (3.10.0)

  * Implemented Generalized Directory Search (GDS) inserting directory
    separators at all possible positions of the search string. See the
    man-page for details. GDS use is optional. 

xd (3.00.1)

  * Minor modifications due to changes in Bobcat

xd (3.00.0)

  * Complete rewrite of XD according to current views about C++
    
  * This version is now formally offered to Debian Linux

  * Implemented 'ignore' and other directives and extended the earlier set
    of command line options. 

  * Added a man-page. See the man page and xd's usage info shown when the
    program is started without arguments for details about how to use xd

  * The default configuration file is now ~/.xdrc

  * Current configuration defaults are:
        add-root    if-empty
        directories all
        start-at    home

    
xd (2.13)

  * Made XD selfsupporting. libicce isn't required anymore.
    Adapted `build': now uses the -t argument
        
xd (2.11)

  * Oops, embedded links weren't recognized in 2.10. Now the algorithm is
    modified so as to compare the inode/device information. What comes
    first is taken first: it may be the directory link. Apart from that:
    the same operational functionality as in 2.10.
    The line 'directories pure' should now be 'directories unique',
    but it's also the default, so it can safely be omitted.

xd (2.10)

  * Solutions reducing to the same file (e.g., via links)
    are prevented by default. In order to get all solutions
    the line 'directories all' must be included in the xd.conf file.

xd (2.09)

  * libicce.a is now containing the NonCanon etc. classes. The formerly
    used library libcclib.a. This library and the ICString.h, ICError.h,
    ARG.h, NonCanon.h and ConfigFile.h files (normally in
    /usr/local/include) can be removed. The functionality of xd has
    not been changed.

xd (2.08)

  * from the $HOME directory fails.

  * In xd.conf this may be suppressed by entering a line containing
        extra no

  * Alternatively, the extra evaluation may be forced in addition to the
    standard evaluation (from the $HOME directory) if the line
        extra always
    is used in xd.conf
    
  * In the distribution, the xd.conf file is now expected in
    $HOME/.conf/xd/xd.conf
    
  * Prior to the compilation, this path may be set by altering
    XD_CONF_PATH in the file configure.h
    
xd (2.07)

  * First Linux version. Previous versions were for MS-DOS
