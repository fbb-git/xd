2.11	Oops, embedded links weren't recognized in 2.10. Now the algorithm is
	modified so as to compare the inode/device information. What comes
	first is taken first: it may be the directory link. Apart from that:
	the same operational functionality as in 2.10.
	The line 'directories pure' should now be 'directories unique',
	but it's also the default, so it can safely be omitted.

2.10	Solutions reducing to the same file (e.g., via links)
	are prevented by default. In order to get all solutions
	the line 'directories all' must be included in the xd.conf file.

2.09	libicce.a is now containing the NonCanon etc. classes. The formerly
	used library libcclib.a. This library and the ICString.h, ICError.h,
	ARG.h, NonCanon.h and ConfigFile.h files (normally in
	/usr/local/include) can be removed. The functionality of xd has
	not been changed.

2.08
	from the $HOME directory fails.

	In xd.conf this may be suppressed by entering a line containing
	    extra no

	Alternatively, the extra evaluation may be forced in addition to the
	standard evaluation (from the $HOME directory) if the line
	    extra always
	is used in xd.conf
	
	In the distribution, the xd.conf file is now expected in
	$HOME/.conf/xd/xd.conf
	
	Prior to the compilation, this path may be set by altering
	XD_CONF_PATH in the file configure.h
	
2.07	First Linux version. Previous versions were for MS-DOS
