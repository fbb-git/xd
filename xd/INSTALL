This are the installation instructions for xd.

Quick Installation instruction:
===============================

1. Do as root in the directory where xd unpacked to:

	    install xd /usr/local/bin
	    
to install the provided version of xd in /usr/local/bin

2. Add the following alias to your csh.cshrc (or whatever file you use as
your system-wide alias file):
   
	    alias   xd	'cd `/usr/local/bin/xd \!*`'


Extensive Installation Instruction:
===================================

Preliminaries:
--------------

You need icmake to compile xd yourself. Icmake may be obtained from
ftp.icce.rug.nl, or from sunsite.unc.edu or from tsx-11.mit.edu.

If you don't have icmake, you have to compile and link all sources by hand.
No support for this case is provided here.

--------------

Xd depends on some classes defined in the libicce-library. The library (and its
sources) can be obtained from ftp.icce.rug.nl, in the directory pub/unix. 

Installation Instructions:
--------------------------

1. All instructions should be done from the directory where
   the xd.X.YY.tgz archive unpacked to (i.e., xd/).
2. Make sure you have the libicce.a library (e.g., in /usr/local/lib)
   and the associated header files (e.g., in /usr/local/include/icce)
   installed.
3. If preferred, edit the name of the configurationfile to be used.
   to do this, edit in configure.h, the #define XD_CONFIG_PATH.
   It is always relative to $HOME, and in the distribution it is set
   to "/.conf/xd/xd.conf".
4. Do (not necessarily as root)
	./build
    This creates in the current directory libxd.a and xd.
    During the compilation, two warnings are generated.
    They can safely be ignored.
5. Do (as root)
	install xd /usr/local/bin
6. Add the following alias to your csh.cshrc (or whatever file you use as
   your system-wide alias file):
   
    alias	xd		'cd `/usr/local/bin/xd \!*`'

Cleanup-instructions.
---------------------

Some simple cleanup may be required. The compilation left libxd.a and xd.
All other intermediate compilation products were removed by build.

If required, libxd.a and xd can be removed.
