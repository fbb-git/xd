Preliminaries:
--------------

You should use icmake to compile xd. Icmake may be obtained from
http://icmake.sourceforge.net

If you don't have icmake, you have to compile and link all sources by hand.
No support for this case is provided here.

To construct the man-page you need Yodl. Yodl can be obtained from
http://yodl.sourceforge.net 

Both icmake and yodl are available as Debian linux packages, see
www.debian.org 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Xd itself depends on the Bobcat library. Bobcat is found at
http://bobcat.sourceforge.net.

All prerequisites are also available as Debian Linux packages, see
www.debian.org

Installation Instructions:
--------------------------

1. All commands should be entered in the directory where
   the xd_XX.YY.ZZ.tar.gz archive unpacks to (i.e., xd-XX.YY.ZZ/).
2. Make sure you have the bobcat library and headers installed
3. Verify (and optionally modify) the directory locations in INSTALL.im
    (usually the default paths are fine)
4. Do (not necessarily as root):
        ./build program
    This creates tmp/bin/xd, and 
        ./build man
    This creates tmp/man/xd.1 and tmp/manhtml/xdman.html  
5. Do (now as root):
    to install the program xd itself:
        ./build install program
    to install the man-page:
        ./build install man
    to install the additional standard documentation:
        ./build install std

6. Read the man-page for useful bash- and/or tcsh aliases to be used with xd.

Cleanup-instructions.
---------------------

./build distclean should cleanup all files created during the construction
process of either program or man-page. Alternatively, remove the xd-XX.YY.ZZ
directory extracted from xd_XX.YY.ZZ.tar.gz
