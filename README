The program xd is used to perform eXtra fast Directory changes. Usually to
change a directory the user is required to enter a command like, e.g., cd
/usr/local/bin, possibly with the aid of shell completion. In many cases this
is a tedious task: shell completion shows all entries, including files, when
we're only interested in directories and the full specification of our
intented directory may eventually require many keyboard actions.

When multiple expansions are available xd offers a list of alternatives from
which the user may select an option by simply pressing an associated
key. Directories that are never selected by the user may be ignored using
directives in xd's configuration file. 


To create the program from its sources, either descend into the xd
directory, or unpack a created archive, cd into its top-level directory 
and follow the instructions provided in the INSTALL file found there.

Alternatively, binary ready-to-install versions of xd are available in verious
Linux distributions, in particular Debian. See, e.g.,
https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=xd&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all
