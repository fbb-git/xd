The program xd is used to perform eXtra fast Directory changes. Usually to
change a directory the user is required to enter a command like, e.g., cd
/usr/local/bin, possibly with the aid of shell completion. In many cases this
is a tedious task: shell completion shows all entries, including files, when
we're only interested in directories and the full specification of our
intented directory may eventually require many keyboard actions.


Xd's repository has moved to https://gitlab.com/fbb-git/xd
and is not maintained at this location anymore.
